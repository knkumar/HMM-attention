## HMM for describing attention from cursor movements

The code here can be used to quantify aspects of human attention in an experimental paradigm described here - https://cogsci.mindmodeling.org/2018/papers/0139/0139.pdf. This experimental paradigm is an improvement from an earlier paradigm https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjpsyc.128.2.0253?seq=1 to obtain a continuous measure of attention. A continuous measure of attention has the benefit of assessing an individual's selective and sustained attention. More importantly, the vast amounts of data provided by the paradigm allows sophisticated analysis to assess individual differences. 

This repository describes the use of HMM modeling in 4 stages:

1. Transform data for use in HMM (in folder pre)
2. Generate fits from HMM (in folder model)
3. Fix fits from HMM based on knowledge of attention (in folder fix)
4. Summarize fits to generate necessary observations about an individual's attention. 

### Transform data

### Generate fits

### Fix fits based on operational constraints of attention

### Summarize fits to observe an individual's attention
